We'll ride through ponderosa and aspen forests on a fun 2 day section of the Arizona Trail leading up to our first view of the Canyon at its East Rim. We then traverse the plateau to finish the last days of the tour on the magnificent Rainbow Rim Trail. This is mountain biking at its best with winding singletrack and stunning views into the Grand Canyon.

Our ride begins atop the Orange Cliffs with distant views of snow-capped mountains and a glimpse of the rugged terrain we'll soon encounter. Our two-night stay at the Maze Overlook will convince you there is not a more beautiful spot anywhere. The riding is as fun as anything you might find on Moab's classic trails. Both tours provide a full day of hiking through the heart of the Maze and past the Chocolate Drops formation. The six day tour allows time for a hike to the Great Gallery, a world-renowned example of ancient \"Barrier Canyon\" rock art. Book the 6-day version here! For 2026, our tours will have some variety in the campsite selection. Some tours will utilize Golden Stairs campsite on the 1st night, leaving day 2 as a longer ride-and-hike day, camping at the Maze Overlook above the Harvest scene. These trips are designated on the reservations calender with \"Maze (5) day Golden Stairs\". There will also be a 4-day version visiting the spectacular high-camp \"Panorama Point\" before descending the Flint Trail to Golden Stairs camp and then on to Teapot Rock. This will be a fun alternative Maze or an option for a shorter visit.

Our trail choices are longtime favorites including Teocalli Ridge, Reno Ridge, Brush Creek and more. You'll view mountain peaks in every direction as well as the best wildflower show in Colorado. Camp each day is beside a roaring creek, and within moments of the trail. Elevations range from 9,000 to 12,000 feet with mileage ranging from 17-30 miles a day. Plan an extra day or two to take in one of the many summer festivals and to explore the picturesque town of Crested Butte. We have been loving Ebikes in the Crested Butte high country, and can't wait to share more of it with you all. We are pioneering backcountry ebike adventures and our solar-battery charging systems will keep the batteries charged up. eBikes are allowed on motorized trails in the Crested Butte area on Gunnison National Forest Lands. Fortunately, many classic rides are part of this fantastic network, but not 401, or Doctors Park. Expect to get off the beaten path, ride new trails, and maybe an extra lap of your favorite too. These singletrack trails are Upper Intermediate riding, but can be tailored to the group's interests. Descriptive Video",

    "description": "Some General information on Support/Sag trips: Many groups wish to run their own trips but don't have the means to haul their gear into the backcountry. Rim Tours offers the option where we carry your gear and you can also rent any or all of the camping gear that you might need. Please see below for more details. Our service includes a truck and driver for Moab area trips. There are additional costs for renting gear and for travel to tours outside the Moab area. Please contact us for quotes. For White Rim trips, you must secure your own camping permit. Contact Canyonlands National Park to do so at 435-259-4351 You are hiring a driver, not a guide. You should not expect a \"guided trip\" from your driver or expect them to be with you at all times. You can work out the general day's plan with your driver so everyone is clear on what is going on and where you will be meeting up together again. Because of limited space in the support vehicle, you will have to provide your own transportation to the start of the ride or arrange a shuttle with us. We will be supplying an open pickup-up truck with a rack system that can carry up to 4 bikes and has sides to keep your gear contained within the rack and pick-up bed. The sides double as tables which you can use.",

    "subtitle": "Renowned epic ride: rugged mountain, flowy technical, unforgiving drops",
    "description": "This world-renowned epic ride has it all -- rugged & remote mountain terrain, flowy and technical singletrack and unforgiving red rock drops on multiple sections. The entire route is 28 miles, with the highest point at 11,200 ft and the lowest point at 4,200 ft along the Colorado River. However, depending on the time of year and trail conditions, shuttles will put in at the highest available trailhead. The Whole Enchilada trail system includes the following trail segments, in descending order: Burro Pass (usually available July – Oct), Hazzard County, Kokopelli Down, UPS, LPS and Porcupine Rim. Our guides will show you the lines and ensure your experience is the best it can be, even if it means cutting out portions of the journey. This ride will test your skills and your stamina as there is over 2,000 ft of climbing in this “pedally downhill” ride. Exit options along the route lead to alternate trails that can provide a less extreme riding experience. Additional shuttle charges will apply.

The package is priced as a half day mountain bike tour of your choice, and river activity of your choice. If you want the combo in one day: It begins with a morning mountain bike ride that takes you on some of Moab’s best terrain. You’ll finish the day with the river portion. The two main river options are: White Water Rafting where your guide does the paddling and you relax and enjoy the ride, or Kayaking where you get an “upper body workout” as you paddle in a solo or tandem inflatable kayak down a beautiful section of the Colorado River. It’s helpful if you have a little riding or paddling experience, but advanced skills are not necessary. River portion is provided by a local professional outfitter. Note about dates: During May through mid-September, the two activities can occur on the same day (biking AM, river activity PM.) During early spring (April) and from September 17 on, there is not enough time to do both tours on the same day. If that's when you are visiting, you have three options: choose two different dates. ask us to book the bike tour as a private tour so that it can be customized to fit with your afternoon river activity. if you're not sure about the river activity, simply book your bike tour using the \"Book Tour\" button on the tour of your choice (go to the upper menu bar, select Day Tour and then the Tour of our choice.) As you are booking that tour, add a note that you'd like to convert it into a Pedal & Paddle and we will help you from there on the river activity.",

    "description": "Bikepacking is exciting and rewarding form of off-pavement, adventure bike touring. You carry all your gear on the bike, from food/water to camp kit to repairs and navigation. Think ultralight backpacking, but on your mountain bike! We are offering introductory courses in bikepacking that would teach participants all you need to set out on their own independent tours. Given the educational nature of this experience, the layout will look a little different than our classic supported tour offerings. Both courses will cover all the same information and skills, but the riding/shakedown tour portion of each course will be in different levels of terrain challenge. Our May trip will feature intermediate terrain with more challenging climbs and some technical sections of 4x4 roads while the June date will ride on moderate terrain with less technical challenge. Day 1 for both trips facilitates a clinic on preparation and packing for your ride and Days 2-4 will be out on the trail putting it all into practice.

Towering 2,000 feet above the Colorado River, the park provides a breathtaking panorama of the Canyonlands area with sculpted pinnacles and buttes. This super fun intermediate singletrack has rolling terrain, mixed with some short climbs and lots of fun sections to cruise on. Some previous mountain bike experience is highly recommended. Class 1 Ebikes only at DHP Brand new Santa Cruz Ebikes will take us on an epic ride, and are included with all tours. The pedal-assist bikes ride just like a regular bike and only power when you pedal. This natural feeling boost will help you conquer moves like never before and deliver miles of smiles. Don't let the motor fool you though! All the essential and technical skills of mountain biking still apply, and you will still work up a great sweat. Deadhorse Point trails are primarily rock at times and require intermediate technical skills and previous off-road mountain bike experience. We enjoy the Intrepid Trail in the morning on our half-day tours. On our full-day tours we include lunch at the park’s main viewpoint and finish our day on the more challenging Twisted Tree and Prickly Pear trail segments on the west side of the park.",
