**Long Description:**
> Durango's Colorado Trail Tour combines some of the best continuous technical singletrack there is and defines backcountry mountain biking. If you're looking for the most extreme guided mountain biking tour, you've found it. Elevations are high, between 9,000 and 12,000 feet and the views are amazing with the entire San Juan range expanding before you. Rewarding your effort is the final day's "kick ass" 5,000-foot descent. The views include gorgeous basins of wildflowers with backdrops of red mountains, deep green forests and alpine lakes. Our 5-day trip adds the classic Hermosa Creek Trail as a great warm-up ride. For further details, view a photo gallery about this tour. Durango - Colorado Trail Photo Gallery
