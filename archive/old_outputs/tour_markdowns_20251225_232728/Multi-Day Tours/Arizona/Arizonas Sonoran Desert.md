**Long Description:**
> Looking for winter mountain biking tours in the sun? Arizona's Sonoran Desert is the perfect place to escape the winter doldrums and Rim Mountain Bike Tours is the best outfitter providing multi-day, camping-based, winter cycling tours in the sun. In the northern states, cycling during the winter can be exhilarating (and brisk!) but sometimes you just want to feel the warm winter sun on your back as you cruise an awesome, smooth and rolling singletrack through hillsides dotted with shapely saguaros and spiny ocotillo cacti. Our early and late winter tour dates will extend your riding season as you witness the earliest wildflower show anywhere in the USA. We will explore McDowell Mountain Park and the Sonoran Preserve with views of the nearby Superstition Mountains as well as travel to the area's best rides. This tour features warm temperatures, abundant wildlife and superb desert singletrack. For further details, view a photo gallery about this tour. Arizona's Sonoran Desert Photo Gallery
