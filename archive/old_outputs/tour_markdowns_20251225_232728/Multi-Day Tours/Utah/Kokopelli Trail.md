**Long Description:**
> This is a journey through the lands of the mythical "Kokopelli" or wandering flute player exemplified in Southwest rock art. Our route ranges from singletrack to slickrock, aspens to pinyon pines and offers sights that will wow your senses and terrain that will definitely test your riding skills. The Kokopelli Trail begins with challenging singletrack, leading to fun, rugged 4 wheel drive trails that touch periodically on the Colorado River. From the Top of the World we descend into Fisher Valley and Onion Creek Canyon, one of the most beautiful and colorful spots in Moab's Canyon Country. The final day offers a choice of riding Moab's legendary Porcupine Rim or Slickrock Trails.
