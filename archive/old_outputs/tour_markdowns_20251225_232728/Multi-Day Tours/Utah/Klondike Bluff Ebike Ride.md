**Long Description:**
> A classic Moab ride, made great again with Ebikes! We will warm up with a few miles of cruising road approaching Klondike Bluff, getting used to the ebikes abilities. You'll gain elevation (approximately 700 ft.) as you “get your pedal on” up toward the boundary of Arches National Park. Keep your eyes open for the dinosaur tracks embedded in sandstone along the way. Riders will experience a variety of Moab’s unique terrain including slickrock and short technical rocky sections. At the top of the climb, a short hike takes us into a remote area of the park and breathtaking views of the colorful bluffs below. The return ride is an awesome downhill across vast tilted sandstone.
