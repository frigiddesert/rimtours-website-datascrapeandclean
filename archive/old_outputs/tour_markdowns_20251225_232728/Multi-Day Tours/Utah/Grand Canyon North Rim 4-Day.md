**Long Description:**
> Take in the unforgettable views of the Grand Canyon's wild northern borders! On this tour we explore the remote Kaibab Plateau rising high above the magnificent Grand Canyon. We'll ride through ponderosa and aspen forests on a fun 2 day section of the Arizona Trail leading up to our first view of the Canyon at its East Rim. We then traverse the plateau to finish the last days of the tour on the magnificent Rainbow Rim Trail. This is mountain biking at its best with winding singletrack and stunning views into the Grand Canyon. The combination of high desert vistas, forest trails and alpine meadows make for an incredibly scenic route. Riders of varying abilities will enjoy the terrain that offers a choice of riding options from secluded forest roads to more challenging singletrack.
