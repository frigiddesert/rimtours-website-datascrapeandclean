**Long Description:**
> New for 2026, E-Bikes are now allowed on Moab's singletrack network of trails ! Enjoy riding Santa Cruz full suspension E-Bikes on fun and challenging singletrack. The South Klonzo Trails offer a carnival-like atmosphere on trails such as Houdini and Roller Coaster which are a great introduction to Moab singletrack. Moderate riders will enjoy a morning of fun on a variety of packed dirt, slickrock and winding singletrack trails. For riders with a little more experience and stamina, ride the North trails and pedal on rockier terrain. The Wahoo and Gravitron segments will leave you with a huge smile on your face at the end of this great tour! For further details, view a photo gallery about this tour. Klonzo Trails Photo Gallery
