**Long Description:**
> Oregon's Central Cascade range features a high desert climate with a striking landscape of snow capped volcanic peaks, blue alpine lakes and forests of lodge pole and ponderosa pine. Best of all, this area also hosts a beautiful trail system. With trail elevations below 7,000 feet, this tour offers riders exceptional singletrack at moderate elevations. From our meeting point in Bend, we'll explore the intricate trail system not far out of town and then move on to the Mt. Bachelor and Cascade Lakes area west of Bend and Sun River. All of our rides boast remarkably well maintained trails, gorgeous vistas of nearby volcanic created mountains, few fellow travelers to meet on the trails and pristine lakes with fishing opportunities for the angler/mt. biker. Join us to discover why this is our new summer favorite riding local!
