**Long Description:**
> On this new tour we will use e-bikes to explore the best Singletracks along the route of The Kokopelli Trail from Fruita, CO to Moab, UT. Backcountry campsites allow ample time to take in the majestic corridor of the Colorado river at the Utah/CO border. Highlights include Fruita's 18 Road, home of boundless flow and some of the most "pure fun" trails anywhere. Ebikes will allow us to hit tons of trail, and say yes to extra laps. We'll then make our way towards "Rabbit Valley" and the Western Rim trail, t raversing the rock rims above the Colorado River, the sometimes technical and narrow trails climb and descend through high desert terrain with expansive vistas towards Moab. As we develop and perfect this new trip, the itinerary is subject to change to create the best experience.
