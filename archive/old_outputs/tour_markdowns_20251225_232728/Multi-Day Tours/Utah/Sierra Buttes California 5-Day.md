**Long Description:**
> From our lakeside base camp in the Tahoe National Forest northeast of Yuba City, CA, each day will feature shuttles to the area’s world-class singletracks, including several lengthy downhill runs like the Downieville Downhill (intermediate to technical). Other days will feature a mix of climbs and descents through mossy forests with vast views of alpine lakes, fast and flowy singletracks with sweeping banked turns, occasional rock slabs and natural bumps, and cross-country loops. Rides may include high-speed sections with long sight lines, tabletop jumps for those who love air time and finishing at creek-side swimming holes, though all rides can be taken at a more mellow pace – you can make it easier or harder, depending on your skill and comfort level.
