**Long Description:**
> The Grand Staircase-Escalante, one of Utah's newest National Monuments, defies description with its varied and remote terrain. The riding is mostly moderate but includes a few challenging sections of trail with short steep climbs and descents and rocky or sandy washes at between 4,000 - 7,000 feet elevation. We start our adventure in Boulder, Utah with a rolling downhill ride on the Burr Trail through the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The ride continues with great swooping climbs and descents interspersed with sweeping views of the Waterpocket Fold, the Henry Mountains and Navajo Mountain. We'll visit the Wolverine Petrified Wood Area, Capitol Reef National Park and hike through Upper Muley Twist Canyon. We end with a downhill run to Bullfrog Bay, on the shores of Lake Powell. We camp in two different locations. This is a perfect tour for a mixed abilities group or for those looking for a relaxed pace of travel. Mileage each day varies with options and short hikes allow us time off our bikes to explore hidden canyon trails. For those considering doing a multi-day tour for their first time, especially those who have little or no camping experience, we've written a detailed description of what it's like to go on a multi-day tour with us.
