**Long Description:**
> Moab is a great place to improve your riding and experience our other-worldly landscape. Learn how best to tackle our unique terrain from the experts. No matter what your ability, Rim Tours’ guide staff will help refine what you already know and teach you the how-tos for the ride you are on, from basic mountain bike riding skills to more advanced drop-offs, switchbacks and other techniques appropriate for your experience level. We will pick the best trails where we can work specifically on skills for your level and have an awesome ride as we practice. Rim Tours’ Instructional Tours are predominantly trail rides where we spend initial time working on basics and then focus on skill building opportunities along the route, stopping to learn and practice as we continue on the trail. If you are more interested in a more in-depth skills clinic where the majority of your time will be spent on mastering techniques and less time on the actual ride, we recommend contacting our friends at Momentum Mountain Biking for instruction by the hour, day or weekend.
