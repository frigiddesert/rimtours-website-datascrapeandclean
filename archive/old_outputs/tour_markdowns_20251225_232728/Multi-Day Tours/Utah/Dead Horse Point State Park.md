**Long Description:**
> Dead Horse Point is one of Utah’s most spectacular state parks and offers a great taste of what Moab mt biking is all about. Towering 2,000 feet above the Colorado River, the park provides a breathtaking panorama of the Canyonlands area with sculpted pinnacles and buttes. This super fun introduction to singletrack has rolling terrain, mixed with some short climbs and lots of fun sections to cruise on. Some previous mountain bike experience is highly recommended. We enjoy the Intrepid Trail in the morning on our half-day tours. On our full-day tours we include lunch at the park’s main viewpoint and finish our day on the more challenging Twisted Tree and Prickly Pear trail segments on the west side of the park.
