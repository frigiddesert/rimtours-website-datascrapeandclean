**Long Description:**
> "The Butte" is one of the best places you will ever ride, period. This is the place to experience pristine singletrack that has been featured in bike magazines since the inception of the Pearl Pass ride in 1976. Our trail choices are longtime favorites including Teocalli Ridge, Reno Ridge, Brush Creek and more. You'll view mountain peaks in every direction as well as the best wildflower show in Colorado. Camp each day is beside a roaring creek, and within moments of the trail. Elevations range from 9,000 to 12,000 feet with mileage ranging from 17-30 miles a day. Plan an extra day or two to take in one of the many summer festivals and to explore the picturesque town of Crested Butte. We have been loving Ebikes in the Crested Butte high country, and can't wait to share more of it with you all. We are pioneering backcountry ebike adventures and our solar-battery charging systems will keep the batteries charged up. eBikes are allowed on motorized trails in the Crested Butte area on Gunnison National Forest Lands. Fortunately, many classic rides are part of this fantastic network, but not 401, or Doctors Park. Expect to get off the beaten path, ride new trails, and maybe an extra lap of your favorite too. These singletrack trails are Upper Intermediate riding, but can be tailored to the group's interests. Descriptive Video
