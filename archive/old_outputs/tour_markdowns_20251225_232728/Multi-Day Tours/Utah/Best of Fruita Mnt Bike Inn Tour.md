**Long Description:**
> Join us in western Colorado's hot spot for great mountain biking in the hills and fun evenings in town. Fruita's well designed trail system with plenty of singletrack awaits us with options for differing abilities from moderate to advanced terrain. Gorgeous views of the Colorado River along sections of the Kokopelli Trail and riding at the base of the dramatic Book Cliffs are among the highlights. Two nights are spent with the group at the area's better restaurants reminiscing on the days' adventures. Itineraries can be customized for private groups of 6 or more and we can easily accommodate riders with varying ability levels. Descriptive Video
