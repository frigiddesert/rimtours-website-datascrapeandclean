**Long Description:**
> Simply stated, the Maze is like nothing else. Legends of the old west tell stories of outlaws escaping into its wildly remote and inaccessible canyons. Our ride begins atop the Orange Cliffs with distant views of snow-capped mountains and a glimpse of the rugged terrain we'll soon encounter. Our two-night stay at the Maze Overlook will convince you there is not a more beautiful spot anywhere. The riding is as fun as anything you might find on Moab's classic trails. Both tours provide a full day of hiking through the heart of the Maze and past the Chocolate Drops formation. The six day tour allows time for a hike to the Great Gallery, a world-renowned example of ancient "Barrier Canyon" rock art. Book the 6-day version here! For 2026, our tours will have some variety in the campsite selection. Some tours will utilize Golden Stairs campsite on the 1st night, leaving day 2 as a longer ride-and-hike day, camping at the Maze Overlook above the Harvest scene. These trips are designated on the reservations calender with "Maze (5) day Golden Stairs". There will also be a 4-day version visiting the spectacular high-camp "Panorama Point" before descending the Flint Trail to Golden Stairs camp and then on to Teapot Rock. This will be a fun alternative Maze or an option for a shorter visit. For those considering doing a multi-day tour for their first time, especially those who have little or no camping experience, we've written a detailed description of what it's like to go on a multi-day tour with us.
