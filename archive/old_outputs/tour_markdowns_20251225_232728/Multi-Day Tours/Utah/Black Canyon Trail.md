**Long Description:**
> Join Rim Tours for a fantastic mountain bike journey through the upper Sonoran Desert between Scottsdale and Sedona, including the Sonoran Preserve and Black Canyon Trails. The sometimes challenging intermediate terrain hosts saguaro forests and rugged canyons and offers exciting long-distance singletrack that is classified as an IMBA Epic Ride and a National Recreation Trail. We will meet in Phoenix so travel shouldn’t be hard to arrange to whisk you from cold winter temps to sunshine and short sleeves. We start with 2 mellow days warming up in Scottsdale at McDowell Regional Park, then head north to the start of the Black Canyon Trail, where we spend 3 days on The Black Canyon Trail and staying at the historic Bumblebee dude ranch. Expect pokey cactus, potential water crossings and challenging riding. The Black Canyon Trail is an advanced route.
