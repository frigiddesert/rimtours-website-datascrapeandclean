**Long Description:**
> Fruita is renowned for its flowy singletrack and Rim Tours has always taken guests there on our Kokopelli tours, and now we are excited to showcase the Ebike Singletrack on tap. World-famous "18 Road" is an incredibly fun system of loops, and is now open to Class 1 Ebikes. We will base camp here and enjoy 3 days of riding. Grand Junction is more easily accessed than Moab, and makes this an ideal getaway. ** Group Trips ** We are happy to offer this trip to private groups at anytime that is best for you, in addition to offering pre-planned group dates. **
