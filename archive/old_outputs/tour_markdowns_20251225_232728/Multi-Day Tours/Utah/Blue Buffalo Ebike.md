**Long Description:**
> This classic Rim Tour gets resurrected for Ebikes in 2023! Ride from the historic Mill Canyon stage station through a small canyon out to vast expanses of slickrock. Ebikes make it a blast to zip up and down the slickrock, and a long-wide open descent back to the vehicles offers plenty of opportunity for high-speed, without exposure or cliffs. This tour is suitable for those riders with some Mtb or off-road cycling experience. If you are looking for another fun Ebike ride, check out Klondike Bluffs Beginner’s Ebike Tour .
