**Long Description:**
> This "best of" tour combines world-class mountain biking on Moab's legendary trails with the opportunity to sample local dining and lodging. Each day our professional guides will show you one of the area's best rides; along the way you'll improve your mountain biking skills, enjoy a delicious trailside lunch, and take in Moab's magnificent scenery. After a full day on the trail, we'll return to comfortable lodging and in the evening gather for dinner at one of Moab's many fine restaurants. Itineraries can be customized for private groups of 6 or more and we can easily accommodate riders with varying ability levels. Also, if you have a group of road bikers and would like a road bike version of the Best of Moab, we would be happy to set one up for you.
