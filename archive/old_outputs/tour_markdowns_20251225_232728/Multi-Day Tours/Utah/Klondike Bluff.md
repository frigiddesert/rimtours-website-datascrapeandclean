**Long Description:**
> This is a classic Moab ride! You'll gain elevation (approximately 700 ft.) as you “get your pedal on” up toward the boundary of Arches National Park. Having a very good fitness base will help you enjoy this ride. Keep your eyes open for the dinosaur tracks embedded in sandstone along the way. Riders will experience a variety of Moab’s unique terrain including slickrock and short technical rocky sections. At the top of the climb, a short hike takes us into a remote area of the park and breathtaking views of the colorful bluffs below. Remember, the return ride is almost all downhill!
