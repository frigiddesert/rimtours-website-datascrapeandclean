**Long Description:**
> Join us for a 4-day backcountry adventure in Moab's canyon country! We'll ride from the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park to Moab. With its primitive spirit and Wild West atmosphere, our ride past towering hoodoos and otherworldly rock formations through Lockhart Basin offers the perfect getaway. This remote route loosely follows the Colorado River, along a rugged 4-wheel drive road that offers mountain bikers a fun and mostly moderate tour. Fantastic views of canyons, mesas, buttes, and spires, wide-open spaces, and solitude define this backcountry tour.
