**Long Description:**
> This world-renowned epic ride has it all -- rugged & remote mountain terrain, flowy and technical singletrack and unforgiving red rock drops on multiple sections. The entire route is 28 miles, with the highest point at 11,200 ft and the lowest point at 4,200 ft along the Colorado River. However, depending on the time of year and trail conditions, shuttles will put in at the highest available trailhead. The Whole Enchilada trail system includes the following trail segments, in descending order: Burro Pass (usually available July – Oct), Hazzard County, Kokopelli Down, UPS, LPS and Porcupine Rim. Our guides will show you the lines and ensure your experience is the best it can be, even if it means cutting out portions of the journey. This ride will test your skills and your stamina as there is over 2,000 ft of climbing in this “pedally downhill” ride. Exit options along the route lead to alternate trails that can provide a less extreme riding experience. Additional shuttle charges will apply.
