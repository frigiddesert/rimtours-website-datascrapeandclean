**Long Description:**
> New for 2026, E-Bikes are now allowed on Moab's singletrack network of trails ! Enjoy riding Santa Cruz full suspension E-Bikes on fun and challenging singletrack. How about some super fun riding on yet another Moab classic ride? Multiple trail sections allow us to ride a variety of terrain with some slickrock and flowing trails that offer spectacular views along the canyon rims. Take a break at Gemini Bridges and soak in the twin arches formed by water over the ages. Mag 7 has options that make it a great ride for an incredible half day tour, or extend the your riding time with an awesome Full Day Tour adventure. This tour is typically ridden as a loop and does not include the shuttled ride with the Portal segment. Descriptive Video
