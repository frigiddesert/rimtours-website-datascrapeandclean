**Long Description:**
> Travel the spectacular canyon country between two of Utah's most stunning National Parks! We'll begin our adventure on the Virgin River Rim Trail, a sensational singletrack trail winding through pine & aspen groves, with views of the cliffs of Zion in the distance. Then it's on to Red Canyon, riding beneath blazing pink cliffs and wildly eroded rock formations known as Hoodoos, just outside Bryce Canyon National Park. The backcountry terrain we cover between the two parks is beautiful. Singletrack enthusiasts will love this ride and options are available each day for less experienced riders.
