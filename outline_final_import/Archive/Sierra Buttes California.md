**Season:** Summer

**Short Description:**
> Singletrack, alpine lakes, climbs and downhill runs in Northern California's Sierra Nevada Mountains

**Long Description:**
> From our lakeside base camp in the Tahoe National Forest northeast of Yuba City, CA, each day will feature shuttles to the area’s world-class singletracks, including several lengthy downhill runs like the Downieville Downhill (intermediate to technical). Other days will feature a mix of climbs and descents through mossy forests with vast views of alpine lakes, fast and flowy singletracks with sweeping banked turns, occasional rock slabs and natural bumps, and cross-country loops. Rides may include high-speed sections with long sight lines, tabletop jumps for those who love air time and finishing at creek-side swimming holes, though all rides can be taken at a more mellow pace – you can make it easier or harder, depending on your skill and comfort level.

## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
After we meet in Graeagle, we will caravan up to our campsite at
  Gold Lake to set up camp for the week.   We will ride from camp. We will
  climb for about 3 miles up a gravel road to get to the top of Mills Peak.
  Fabulous views at the top of the tower at the peak will give you a good
  perspective of the area.  Then for the fun part. Mills Peak trail is a
  classic super fast fun downhill trail.  Mills Peak is peppered with rocks
  as well as some flowy sections, so keep your guard up.  At the end of
  this ride we will grab a shuttle back to our camp (Bring your face
  covering please).

### Day 2
After a hearty breakfast, we will make our way from camp and ride
  to Graeagle via trails around the Lakes Basin area. Super fun and often a
  little rock and tricky, plenty of opportunity to challenge yourself with
  fun technical terrain. We will have some options on this day to make
  things harder or cruiser.

### Day 3
Ride: variable Miles
  Trails: Round Lake Loop from camp
  Camp: Gold Lake
  Meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, Snacks

### Day 4
We break camp and drive to Downieville, the location of the famous
  Downieville Classic Bike race. From here we will shuttle to above 7,000
  ft to the Sunrise trail, to Butcher Ranch, a roller coaster of fun
  technical single track with a total of almost 7000 ft of descending, with
  of course a few short climbs to keep you honest.  Everyone should finish
  with a big smile on this day with plenty of stories to share.














  The nature of a single-track tour prevents the support truck from
  accompanying the riders.  Each rider is responsible for carrying his/her
  own lunch, water, and gear for the day's ride.  Gear you will want to
  carry with you includes good rain gear and some warm clothing, preferably
  wool, fleece or polypropylene.


  Important- Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including
  but not limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip
  logistics and rider safety






















                     We look forward to riding with you!

                   Please call or e-mail for more details.
