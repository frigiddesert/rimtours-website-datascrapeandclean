## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Our staff will meet you in Bend, Oregon at 8:30 am at the
DoubleTree Hotel by Hilton in downtown Bend on Day 1 of your tour.  Please
have breakfast before meeting us - the hotel offers a good breakfast if you
are staying here.  We will arrange to leave your cars at the hotel or
nearby for the length of the trip.  After meeting and loading gear, we’ll
shuttle the group to our first trailhead not far from town.  Our ride today
explores the lower elevation Phil’s Trails (4,000-5,000 ft) and visits
Tumalo Falls for lunch. This will give you a chance to acclimate and get a
sense of what the trails are like here, narrow and super fun.  There are
opportunities for differing mileages depending on the desires of the group,
from 10-22 miles of fun, rolling singletrack and some doubletrack.  After
riding we’ll have a quick shuttle to our camp on the shores of Little
Cultus Lake where we will spend the week amidst the forest surrounding the
lake with opportunities for more exploring and swimming in the lake.

Once camp is set, you’re free to kick back! Your guides will take care of
the details from setting up lawn chairs with hors d'oeuvres and the drink
cooler nearby, to cooking up a healthy, delicious meal. Washbasins are
available for clean up and a solar shower is usually available for at least
2 nights during the trip. This is your time to relax, whether it's lounging
around camp with our library of books or setting out for a hike or ride to
explore your surroundings.

### Day 2
From Little Cultus Lake today our ride will explore 2 more alpine
lakes, Lemish and Charlton Lakes.  Today’s ride features a bit more
challenging terrain with more climbing but also more descending (our
reward!)  The singletrack trails wind through towering ponderosas and
lodgepole pine forests with occasional broad vistas of the rolling
mountains around us. Elevations range between 4700 ft and 5800 ft. and
mileage totals 19.

### Day 3
After a hot and hearty breakfast we’ll take a short shuttle before
hitting the trail!  In the shadow of Tumalo Mountain we’ll begin today’s 20-
mile ride.  We’ll begin with a warm up loop beneath Tumalo Mt. and then
make our way along the Metolius-Windago trail to Lava Lake on the west side
of Mt. Bachelor.  Once at camp there are options for swimming and
additional riding to see more of this beautiful area.

### Day 4
Today we’ll warm up with a climb up to Irish and Taylor Lakes, 2
secluded and picturesque lakes on the border of the Three Sisters
Wilderness.  You’ll enjoy a rip-roaring descent back by our camp and then a
super fun rolling singletrack to Big Cultus Lake and around.  This ride can
be an all singletrack out and back or combined with some road riding for a
loop.  Mileage today ranges from 16-27 depending on which options you
choose.  Camp is back at Little Cultus with a delicious fireside meal
prepared by your guides.

### Day 5
After a quick shuttle to the trailhead we’ll begin our final’s day
ride heading from the Bachelor area back to Bend.  A couple 500 ft. climbs
put us at our high point for the day and then we’ll work our way down.  No
matter what anyone says it’s never all downhill and you’ll earn your right
to rest and relax at the end of this fantastic adventure!  At day’s end
we’ll say our goodbyes or maybe enjoy a beer together in one of two
fantastic brewpubs in town.  Plan to spend a night in Bend to leisurely
enjoy the charms and great food this mountain town has to offer.
