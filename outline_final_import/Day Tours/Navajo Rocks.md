This trail system opened up in 2014 and has introduced yet another “Wow!” factor to Moab mountain biking. A solid intermediate ride, the trail segments include a taste of almost everything that Moab has to offer: gorgeous slickrock terrain, twisting and turning dirt singletrack, ledgy and punchy climbs, and short steep, rocky descents. Riding along the upper end of Sevenmile Canyon and soaking in views of the Monitor and Merrimac buttes with La Sal Mtns in the background will not disappoint. The trails are extensive enough to make a great Full Day Tour as well....
