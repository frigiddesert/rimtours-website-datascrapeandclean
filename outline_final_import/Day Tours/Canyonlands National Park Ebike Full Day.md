**Long Description:**
> This super scenic Ebike tour is a great way to experience Moab mountain biking. The Ebikes allow us to plan an out and back from the summit of the massive Shafer Trail, including the big hill climb on the return. We start with an initial descent 1200ft of well maintained road, to join the White Rim trail and head out Musselman Arch, then optional trek to “Thelma and Louise Point”. Returning back to the summit of the Shafer Trail with the La Sal Mountain in the background.
*Please note: although Ebikes provide amazing assistance, there are hills to climb on this tour! Remember to save some energy for the return climb back up the Shafer Trail.
This tour is a great adventure for differing abilities, with good fitness and some mountain bike experience. We are the Only Company to offer this tour!
