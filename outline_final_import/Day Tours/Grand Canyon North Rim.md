## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
The route for the first day is a section of the Arizona Trail, a
trail that will eventually run north to south across the entire state of
Arizona.  The trail consists of mostly smooth, rolling singletrack but the
route does have several steep climbs and descents so we’ll keep the mileage
moderate (14 miles for the day) so riders have a chance to acclimate.  We
will meet up with the truck at mid-day when your guides will prepare a
tasty buffet lunch. Our destination after lunch is the East Rim Overlook
with our first views into the magnificent canyons below.  We'll camp at a
beautiful forested site near the East Rim Overlook.  There are
opportunities to hike from camp.

Once at camp, the guides will assist you with tent set-up.   At this point
your work is done! The guides will set up lawn chairs and hors d'oeuvres
while you enjoy a cold drink as a healthy delicious meal is prepared.
Washbasins are available for personal use and a solar shower is usually
available for 1 or 2 nights during the trip. This is your time to relax,
whether you chose to lounge around camp with our library of books or set
out for an exploratory hike.

### Day 2
Leaving the East Rim we'll set out on the Arizona Trail on our way
to Upper Tater Canyon and then across the Kaibab Plateau to the North Rim
proper. This is our biggest day of riding with miles totaling 30.  The ride
begins with 3 miles of rolling singletrack. We then alternate on forest
service roads, some of which are closed to vehicular traffic. The terrain
is moderate with a good amount of downhill but there are a couple climbs
that you must conquer before reaching camp at Locust Point.  Our campsite
for the next 2 nights is situated right on the magnificent North Rim of the
Grand Canyon.  The views are amazing and the sunrises, sunsets, and stars
sublime.  There is also beautiful hiking along the rim.

### Day 3
For the next 2 days we’ll explore the Rainbow Rim Trail, one of the
      most scenic 18 miles of singletrack found anywhere!  The Kaibab Ranger
     District constructed this trail with mountain bikers in mind. The fast-
    carving singletrack winds right along the rim of the Kaibab Plateau with
  outstanding views into the Grand Canyon.  We’ll carry lunch on the out and
  back ride to Timp Point.  Riders can also choose to make a loop of today’s
    trail by adding 10 miles of jeep roads to the first half of singletrack.
                                                                   Miles: 18

### Day 4
For our final day we’ll continue riding the rest of The Rainbow Rim
Trail, 9 miles to its end at Parissawampitts Point.  We should finish
riding by noon, enjoy a great lunch and then shuttle back to St. George
arriving between 5:00-6:00.  You may not reach St. George in time to catch
flights so please make lodging arrangements in advance.

The nature of single-track prevents the support truck from accompanying
riders on all sections of the route..
