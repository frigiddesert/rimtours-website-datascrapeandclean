**Long Description:**
> This Ebike Slickrock Trail Tour is one of the most unique rides anywhere and has helped make Moab the mountain biking Mecca that it is. A series of petrified sand dunes has formed the trail into an 11 mile long roller coaster ride. Ebikes will help us conquer the steep hill climbs, but expect extremely steep descents and side slopes, and exposure that will test your mountain bike skills and fitness. This ride requires advanced technical skills, and intermediate fitness even with Ebikes.
If you are interested in riding this world famous trail, but a bit daunted by its reputation, our slickrock-savvy guides can help! We know this terrain and our experienced instructors would be happy to help you improve your technique.
