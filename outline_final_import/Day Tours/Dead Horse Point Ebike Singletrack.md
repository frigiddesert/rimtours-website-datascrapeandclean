**Long Description:**
> Dead Horse Point is one of Utah’s most spectacular state parks and as a state park it is open to Class 1 Ebikes.  Towering 2,000 feet above the Colorado River, the park provides a breathtaking panorama of the Canyonlands area with sculpted pinnacles and buttes. This super fun intermediate singletrack has rolling terrain, mixed with some short climbs and lots of fun sections to cruise on. Some previous mountain bike experience is highly recommended.
Class 1 Ebikes only at DHP
Brand new Santa Cruz Ebikes will take us on an epic ride, and are included with all tours. The pedal-assist bikes ride just like a regular bike and only power when you pedal.  This natural feeling boost will help you conquer moves like never before and deliver miles of smiles.
Don't let the motor fool you though! All the essential and technical skills of mountain biking still apply, and you will still work up a great sweat.  Deadhorse Point trails are primarily rock at times and require intermediate technical skills and previous off-road mountain bike experience.
We enjoy the Intrepid Trail in the morning on our half-day tours. On our full-day tours we include lunch at the park’s main viewpoint and finish our day on the more challenging Twisted Tree and Prickly Pear trail segments on the west side of the park....
