Amasa Back had been a favorite ride since the beginning and now has a world class upgrade with singletrack routes uphill on the Hymasa Trail, and downhill on the much buzzed about Captain Ahab Trail. The classic technical jeep trail still challenges any rider’s ability and climbs for 1,200 vertical feet over ledgy slickrock offering amazing views of the Colorado River, “Behind the Rocks” and La Sal Mts. at the top.
Depending on the day and what your skill set is, we have what you want with this smorgasbord of extreme riding. Offered in both half-day and full-day versions, the full-day tour travels out the mesa to Pothole Arch and returns via Captain Ahab or the gnarlier Rock Stacker and Jackson Trails.
