## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Approximate milage/elevation: 14-18 miles (22-29km)/ ^2190-2340ft (667-713m)
The White Rim is truly a mountain bike classic. We will meet at Rim Tours HQ at 8:30. Please be on time, but not early. Rim Tours staff will explain to you were to park and where to turn in your vehicle keys. You will also meet your guides and be given expedition style dry bags to stow your personal gear in for the trip. If you are bringing alcohol, please give it to your guides to load onto the truck. No glass or computers in your drybags. If you are renting a bike from Rim Tours, you’ll get to meet it and get fit. Arrive ready to ride. Helmets, shoes, and packs should all be ready to go before you load into the shuttle vehicle.
A continental style breakfast will be available at Rim Tours. If you would like to enjoy a proper breakfast we recommend the Love Muffin Café, Red Rock Bakery, or the Jailhouse Café. Please give yourself ample time to wait in line and arrive promptly at 8:30 AM.   
Following brief introductions, we will load into the shuttle van. It’s almost an hour-long drive to Canyonlands and the start of your adventure. The trip will begin at either the Shafer Trail or the Mineral Bottom Trail. This is determined by campsite reservations available on the White Rim. Once at the put in, we'll unload the bikes, provide an orientation, then shove off. Our 4x4 tour truck will follow at a distance providing support to the group with water, snacks and a hearty lunch as we make our way to camp.
Once at camp, we will unload the truck and set up camp. Once your tent is set up and comfortable, your work is done! Your guides will prepare hors d'oeuvres while you relax and enjoy a well deserved cold drink. Hot washcloths will be made available so you can freshen up while a delicious healthy meal is prepared. This is your time to relax, whether you choose to lounge around camp with our library of books or set out for an exploratory hike. As darkness begins descends, watch the light transform your surrounds and get ready for some truly amazing night skies.

### Day 2
3 Approximate milage/elevation: 23-30 miles (37-48km)/ ^3065-3350ft (935-1023m)
Sip morning coffee (or tea) as the sun begins to rise over the Canyonlands. While you enjoy the splendor of the early morning your guides will be busy preparing a hearty breakfast. It’s a great way to begin a day of exploring and pedaling. After breaking camp, we will head back out on the White Rim Road. Regardless of the direction of travel, you will be greeted by stunning vistas and endless views. The riding will generally be moderate both psychically and technically with a few challenging sections along the way. Your ride today will end with the infamous Murphy Hogback climb. Once you reach the top, you will be treated to the satisfaction of a great day of riding and an amazing campsite. While your guides prepare a filling, fresh dinner you will have the opportunity to explore the area, or just relax with the view. After dinner get ready to view planets, satellites, the Milky Way, and more in this Gold-Tier International Dark Skies National Park!

### Day 3
Ride: 23-30 miles
Meals: Hot breakfast, trailside lunch, dinner and snacks.

### Day 4
Approximate milage/elevation: 14-18 miles (22-29km)/ ^2190-2340ft (667-713m)
Be sure to load up at breakfast as today as we continue our adventure. Once packed and loaded, the phenomenal views continue. We will climb back up to the top of the mesa of Island In The Sky. Once we have met the challenge of the day, we will have a relaxing lunch and meet our shuttle van. You will have time to reflect on your travels with your adventure companions as your guides prepare for the arrival back to Moab. Expect to be back to Rim Tours HQ between 4pm and 5pm.  Please make lodging arrangements in advance, as you may not arrive in time to catch flights.
