Rewarding your effort is the final day's "kick ass" 5,000-foot descent. The views include gorgeous basins of wildflowers with backdrops of red mountains, deep green forests and alpine lakes. Our 5-day trip adds the classic Hermosa Creek Trail as a great warm-up ride.

## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
We will then load our support vehicle and shuttle to the famous
  Hermosa Creek trail.  This 20-mile ride is a Durango classic and includes
  a long rolling descent on buffed singletrack.  We'll finish the ride mid-
  afternoon and take a shuttle to Little Molas Lake for tonight's camp and
  a well-earned dinner.  Our camp is high (11,000 ft) so be sure to stay
  well hydrated leading up to the trip, as this will help you acclimate.

### Day 2
After a hearty breakfast, we start our ride along this western
  section of The Colorado Trail, which stretches 470 miles from Denver to
  Durango.  This is some of the most beautiful single-track you will ever
  see.  We pass beneath the Twin Sisters peaks on our way to Rolling
  Mountain Pass and ride the spectacular descent to Cascade Creek.  We then
  travel towards Bolem Pass for our second camp at Celebration Lake.
  Today's ride is the toughest of the trip because we have 2 passes to
  climb. Highlights include the Cascade Creek drainage, with its abundance
  of wildflowers, and the views of spectacular Engineer Mt.   The ride
  totals 21 miles and we reach an elevation of 12,400 ft.

### Day 3
Today we’ll continue on the Colorado Trail towards Hotel Draw over
  Blackhawk Pass, Our high point today. From the pass we begin an
  incredible descent towards Hotel Draw, one of the highpoints of the ride.
   Camp is along a ridge among the Douglas Firs with beautiful sunset
  views.  Today's mileage is 18 miles and we reach an elevation of 12,100
  ft.

### Day 4
Today’s ride traverses the spectacular Indian Ridge Trail and
  includes some short portage sections.  The panoramic view of the entire
  San Juan range from the top is definitely worth the effort.  Look
  carefully for Ptarmigans, a high alpine bird similar to grouse found
  among the tundra rocks.  The trail races down from the high ridge to
  Kennebec Pass and our camp below.  Mileage today is 16 miles and the high
  point reaches 12,300 ft.

### Day 5
Our final day's ride takes us down into Durango where we lose
  5,000 ft. over 26 miles!  There is one 1,000-ft. climb in the middle of
  the ride but that just means more descending!  This is one of our
  favorite sections of trail in all of Colorado and we know you'll finish
  smiling.


  Our main goal for our mountain tours is an early start each morning.
  This will allow us to be up and over the high passes of the trail before
  the possible afternoon thundershowers.  We ask you to be prepared for as
  early a departure as the guides deem necessary, which will probably be
  around 8:30 A.M. on most mornings but may be as early as 7:00 if
  thunderstorms are threatening.


  The nature of a single-track tour prevents the support truck from
  accompanying the riders.  Each rider is responsible for carrying his/her
  own lunch, water, and gear for the day's ride.  Gear you will want to
  carry with you includes good rain gear and some warm clothing, preferably
  wool, fleece or polypropylene.


  Important- Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including
  but not limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip
  logistics and rider safety
