## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Meet at 9:00 AM at the Sleep Inn (at the Sky Harbor Airport), 2621
S. 47th Place, Phoenix, AZ.  (Call for reservations: (480-967-7100.) They
offer a free 24-hour airport shuttle service and continental breakfast.
Please make sure to have breakfast before meeting the group.  Please let us
know if you plan to drive to the meeting point. Please plan on arranging to
leave your car at the hotel you’re staying at during the trip, if they will
not allow you to park, just let us know we have other options.

We will load the support vehicle and then drive about 1 hour to
Scottsdale’s McDowell Sonoran Preserve and head to the Brown’s Ranch
Trailhead.
The guides will lead a brief orientation, and then we’re off.  First day
mileage will be over mostly smooth rolling single-track.  Watch for prickly
cacti as you negotiate the occasional tight corner and short steep descent.
The first day won’t be too long or too hard.  There will be options for
more mileage if you would like to do more pedaling.  Mileage: 15-20 miles

After the ride we will head to McDowell Mountain Regional Park and set up
camp. Drive time is about a half hour. This will be our basecamp for the
next 3 nights.
Back at camp, we will help set up your tents and provide accoutrements to
get cleaned up from riding.  Then, relax - your work is done!  The guides
will take care of you from here.  Enjoy hors d’oeuvres and cold drinks
while a healthy, delicious meal is prepared by your guides.  No need to
feel like you’re “roughing it” on this tour with tidy campsites, bathrooms
and hot showers.

### Day 2
After a hearty breakfast we will hop on our bikes and make our way
to the Pemberton Loop Trail via the Granite and Bluff Trails.  This ride
begins with several miles of curvy rolling singletrack.  After a 4-mile rip-
roaring descent the trail gently climbs for about 3 miles.  After
completing the Pemberton loop we will catch the Granite Trail back to Camp
for lunch. In the afternoon, we will continue to explore the many
singletrack options. The group will relax and enjoy good company as the sun
sets behind the McDowell Mountains, and then we will gather around the
campfire for a delicious dinner.
Mileage: 15-25 miles

### Day 3
Today’s ride takes place at the McDowell Competitive Track. The
three loops that make up the track were built and set-aside just for
mountain bikers.  We will warm up with the Long Loop, a superb section of
singletrack that rolls out over a picturesque desert landscape. After lunch
we’ll tackle the Sport Loop, a shorter but more technically challenging
ride.  Next, you’ll get to test your skills on the Tech Loop, a twisty-
turny ride with steep fast descents.  Once we return to camp, there will be
more riding options for anyone who hasn’t had enough.
Mileage: 16-25 miles

### Day 4
After breakfast we will pack up camp and the group will have the
option to ride and additional day at McDowell, or take a short van ride to
the Scottsdale’s McDowell Sonoran Preserve, a fantastic trail system that
winds around granite buttes and among beautiful desert flora and fauna.
Giant Saguaro’s line the trails as we climb, descend, carve and rip on
prime desert singletrack.  Like McDowell, this area offers riders moderate
to more challenging options.  Expect to ride the best trails that each area
has to offer.  We will pack lunch and then head back to Phoenix for the
conclusion of the tour.
Arrival at The Sleep Inn will be between 4-5:00PM.
Mileage: 18-23 miles

limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip logistics

                     We look forward to riding with you!
