## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
A hot continental breakfast is provided at your hotel but if you’d
like something more substantial there is the Main St. Bagel Bakery, 2
blocks away.  Our guides will meet the group at your hotel at 8:00 AM in
the front lobby. We’ll fit rental bikes and make sure everyone has what
they need for the day before we head out to the trails.
Today we are heading to the Kokopelli trail, named for the mythical flute
player exemplified in southwest rock art.  Our route begins riding parts of
Mary’s Loop, Lion’s Loop and the Horsethief Loop, which are the gems of the
whole trail system.  Portions of the ride offer spectacular views of the
Colorado River and the singletrack is outstanding with some fun but
challenging sections.  We’ll most likely pack a lunch to eat on the trail
and after riding its back to the Suites for hot showers before the group
meets for dinner.

### Day 2
Our guides again will pick you up at your hotel at 8 AM.  For
  today’s ride we'll set out exploring other sections of the Kokopelli
  trail and the offshoot trails of Rabbit Valley and the canyon rims over
  looking the Colorado River.   Our ride today is mostly rolling with fun
  “whoop-de-do's" and a couple challenging climbs. Mileage totals: 20-30
  miles depending on the options we choose.  Tonight we’ll all again gather
  for a delicious dinner out on the town.

### Day 3
This morning we’ll need to check out of the hotel unless you arrange
for an additional night’s stay.
Your guides will pick you up at your hotel at 8:00 unless a different time
is arranged and we can hold your luggage in our van.  We’ll shuttle through
the town of Fruita Colorado, to the playground of trails nestled against
the Bookcliffs, dramatic plateaus of rock eroding into the desert. Fruita
has recently been featured in many cycling magazines as a top 10
destination for mountain biking. You’ll get to know our favorite trails
such as Prime Cut, Joe's Ridge and Chutes & Ladders. We’ll finish riding
early to mid afternoon and lunch today may be trailside or stopping at the
Hot Tomato Café for great pizza after the ride.   As our tour concludes we
can drop you back at the hotel or at the airport if you’ve arranged flights
out today – thanks for riding with us!

                                                                   IMPORTANT
