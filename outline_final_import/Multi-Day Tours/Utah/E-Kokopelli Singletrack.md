## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Load into the van for a short ride to the North Fruita desert, nestled at the base of one of the largest cliff bands in the world.  “18 Road” is a world-renowned riding destination, known for super-fun singletrack, suitable for almost everyone.  Take several laps to get acquinted before stopping at the campsite for lunch, located in the middle of the trail system.  There are dozens of trails, and our ebikes will sweep us back to the top for more, just don’t be late for dinner!     Total Mileage: 20-25+
Return to camp, where you guides will help you pitch your tent and your work is done!  The guides will take care of all the details from preparing hors d'oeuvres to cooking up a healthy delicious meal.  Washbasins are available for clean-up and a solar shower is usually available for one evening during the trip.  It's your time to relax, whether it's lounging around camp with our library of books or setting out for a hike to explore your surroundings.

### Day 2
Awake in nature and enjoy a hearty breakfast before snagging a few more 18 Road laps.  We will migrate to “Rabbit Valley” along the Utah border for lunch. Here we will join the route of our classic Kokopelli ride, and enjoy challenging singletrack on our way to Knowles Canyon Overlook Campground, perched on a cliff above the Colorado River.    Total Mileage:  20-25

### Day 3
Today we will do a classic portion of Rim Tours’ Kokopelli ride; “The Western Rim”.  This scenic singletrack is perched on a slickrock bench along the river, and is a highlight of many visits.  Ebikes will make easier work of a longer day and we’ll work up an appetite as we make our way through a mix of singletrack and 4x4 roads to a riverside camp at “Fish Ford”.  Take the opportunity to dunk in the river before a great final dinner.  This segment features one of the best places in Utah to see bald eagles; other wildlife sightings may include pronghorn, mule deer, and desert bighorn sheep.   Total Mileage: 28-30

### Day 4
Today we will pack our camp and head back towards Grand Junction to ride at the Third Flats trails. These newer, multi-use trails are reminiscent of flowy, bike park trails, and have everything from mild to wild, with great dirt and slickrock sections.  The trails are adjacent to the stunning red rock folds of Bangs Canyon, with views of Colorado National Monument.  Advanced riders can choose to tackle the Windmill Loop, a 22+ mile backcountry epic loop with a 6 mile descent.

***Ebike Rules and Regs****
Ebike Rules in the USA are quite restrictive relative to many other areas.  Most traditional mountain bike trails on FEDERAL lands are not open to eBikes.  As a permittee with the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service and National Park Service, we can only guide on appropriately designated routes.  
This tour is designed to showcase the best singletrack eBiking available in our region, which at this time, is closer to Grand Junction than Moab.   These are evolving management plans and we will adjust this trip accordingly. 

All tours may be adjusted based on riders’ ability, weather conditions, road conditions or other safety concerns.
