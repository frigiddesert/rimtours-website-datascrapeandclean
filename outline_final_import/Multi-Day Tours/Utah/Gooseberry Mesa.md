## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
We meet at 8:00 AM at The Red Lion St. George, Utah. (435)628-4235.
The Inn is located at 850 S. Bluff St. https://www.redlion.com/st-george .
The Inn has a restaurant on site with a very affordable light breakfast or
full breakfast options and we recommend eating before we meet.   Look for
our 15 passenger white van with a utility trailer in the parking lot the
morning of the tour. Our guides will take care of any last minute logistics
and load the support vehicle.   We’ll then be ready to shuttle to the
trailhead, about 40 miles to the Little Creek Mountain.  We’ll ride 14-20
miles of singletrack depending on the exact route we take.  This area has
fun, fast and interspersed on trail and slickrock.  After the ride we’ll
take a short shuttle to our camp on Gooseberry Mesa.

Once camp is set, your work is done! Your guides will take care of the
details from setting up lawn chairs, with hors d'oeuvres and the drink
cooler nearby and cooking up a healthy delicious meal. Washbasins are
available for clean up and a solar shower is usually available for 1 or 2
nights during the trip. This is your time to relax, whether it's lounging
around camp with our library of books or setting out for a hike to explore
your surroundings.

### Day 2
From camp we’ll ride to the trailhead of today’s ride.  Gooseberry
Mesa has a number of loop options and we’ll start with a 12-mile loop on
God’s skateboard Park and Rattlesnake Rim.  The riding is technical and
fun!  Your slow speed handling will greatly improve over the course of the
tour and you’ll marvel at the artistry of the trail’s design.  Back at camp
your guides will once again work their culinary magic.  Miles: 12-22 miles

### Day 3
We’ll explore further on Gooseberry Mesa today as the riding
becomes a bit more challenging and technical.  Our favorites include Hidden
Canyon and the North Rim Trails.  By now you will be feeling a lot more
comfortable with this unique terrain and having a lot of fun conquering the
frequent challenges.  The constant backdrop of Zion’s dramatic cliffs
creates a truly magical playground for mountain bike buffs.  Back at camp
there are always nice hiking opportunities and sunset viewing is supreme
here.

### Day 4
We'll pack up this morning and shuttle to the Hurricane Rim and Jem
Trails. These trails offer buff, smooth singletrack with spectacular views
of the Virgin River Canyon!  We'll gradually climb to the trail's end with
the reward of a fast descent back to the Virgin River.  After riding we'll
load the shuttle vehicle for the ride back to St George arriving between
3:00-5:00PM.  Mileage: 13 - 20 miles

The nature of a single-track tour prevents the support truck from
accompanying the riders.  Each rider is responsible for carrying his/her
own lunch, water, and gear for the day's ride.



Note:  Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including but not
limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip logistics
and rider safety.
