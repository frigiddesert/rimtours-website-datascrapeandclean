**Long Description:**
> This is a journey through the lands of the mythical "Kokopelli" or wandering flute player exemplified in Southwest rock art. Our route ranges from singletrack to slickrock, aspens to pinyon pines and offers sights that will wow your senses and terrain that will definitely test your riding skills.  The Kokopelli Trail begins with challenging singletrack, leading to fun, rugged 4 wheel drive trails that touch periodically on the Colorado River. From the Top of the World we descend into Fisher Valley and Onion Creek Canyon, one of the most beautiful and colorful spots in Moab's Canyon Country. The final day offers a choice of riding Moab's legendary Porcupine Rim or Slickrock Trails.

## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
After packing up our support truck in Moab, we’ll have a 1½ hour
shuttle ride to the trailhead.  We begin our ride west of Grand Junction at
the official Kokopelli Trailhead in Loma, CO.  We’ll climb and descend on
technical singletrack through high desert terrain of juniper and pinyon
pine.  We’ll have sweeping views of the Colorado River as we make our way
towards Salt Creek and Rabbit Valley, and take breaks for snacks and a
delicious trailside lunch.  This is one of the more challenging days of the
tour; you’ll have earned a rest when we reach our scenic camp overlooking
Knowles Canyon.  Mileage: 30-35.

Once camp is set, your work is done!  Your guides will take care of all the
details from preparing hors d'oeuvres to cooking up a healthy delicious
meal.  Washbasins are available for clean-up and a solar shower is usually
available for one evening during the trip.  It's your time to relax,
whether it's lounging around camp with our library of books or setting out
for a hike to explore your surroundings.

### Day 2
This morning’s ride is fun, fast and absolutely fantastic!  We
deviate from the official Kokopelli route to ride singletrack on the West
Rim trail above the Colorado River. We’ll take plenty of breaks for photos
too.  Once we return to the KT we’ll have a challenging climb followed by a
fun descent before lunch.  Our afternoon ride will remind you of the Wild
West of old: wide open spaces, tumbleweeds, and railroad tracks are our
backdrop as we make our way to camp at Fish Ford.  After we reach camp,
there will be opportunities for cooling off at the river's edge.  Mileage:
35-40

### Day 3
This morning we’ll ride a short but memorable section of singletrack
as we make our way towards Dewey Bridge, then we’ll work up an appetite as
we climb up the Entrada Bluffs Road.  After lunch, more climbing, but we’ll
have a respite when we descend into Cottonwood Canyon, a beautiful oasis in
the desert, so named for the majestic native Cottonwood trees found in
abundance here.  Throughout our tour, there will be opportunities to see
birds of prey, including bald eagles; other wildlife sightings may include
pronghorn, mule deer, and desert bighorn sheep.   Today’s ride includes the
biggest elevation gain of the trip approximately 2,000-2,500ft.
Mileage, though only about 23, is well earned.

### Day 4
Today we’ll enjoy the benefits of all the climbing we did
yesterday!  A long and challenging technical descent – culminating with
Rose Garden Hill - will keep us on our toes as we head toward Fisher
Valley.  We’ll divert from the KT when we descend down Onion Creek Canyon,
one of the most geologically spectacular areas around Moab.  After lunch
we’ll shuttle back to Moab for the end of our tour.   Mileage: 15-20 miles.

At the conclusion of the tour in Moab you will receive a complimentary Rim
Tours t-shirt, coffee mug and memories to last a lifetime!
