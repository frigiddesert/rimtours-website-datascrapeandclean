**Region:** Moab Area  
**Skill Level:**   
**Season:** Fall|Spring

**Short Description:**
> Simply stated, the Maze is like nothing else. Legends of the old west tell stories of outlaws escaping into its wildly remote and inaccessible canyons.

**Long Description:**
> Simply stated, the Maze is like nothing else. Legends of the old west tell stories of outlaws escaping into its wildly remote and inaccessible canyons. Our ride begins atop the Orange Cliffs with distant views of snow-capped mountains and a glimpse of the rugged terrain we'll soon encounter. Our two-night stay at the Maze Overlook will convince you there is not a more beautiful spot anywhere. The riding is as fun as anything you might find on Moab's classic trails. Both tours provide a full day of hiking through the heart of the Maze and past the Chocolate Drops formation. The six day tour allows time for a hike to the Great Gallery, a world-renowned example of ancient "Barrier Canyon" rock art. Book the 6-day version here!
For 2026, our tours will have some variety in the campsite selection.  Some tours will utilize Golden Stairs campsite on the 1st night, leaving day 2 as a longer ride-and-hike day, camping at the Maze Overlook above the Harvest scene. These trips are designated on the reservations calender with "Maze (5) day Golden Stairs".
There will also be a 4-day version  visiting the spectacular high-camp "Panorama Point" before descending the Flint Trail to Golden Stairs camp and then on to Teapot Rock.  This will be a fun alternative Maze or an option for a shorter visit.
For those considering doing a multi-day tour for their first time, especially those who have little or no camping experience, we've written a detailed description of what it's like to go on a multi...

## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Please meet the group prepared to hike. After loading bikes and
gear into the support vehicle we will be shuttled to the start of the hike
(1.5-2 hour van ride) at the Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead.  Our destination
is the Great Gallery one of the most famous panels, after a 3.5 mile hike
over compacted gravel and loose sand you will be standing at the base of a
magnificent panel of Barrier Canyon-style rock art.  Enjoy a lunch as you
take in this 2,000 year old pictograph panel.

We will finish the hike mid-afternoon and head to camp at North Point which
is about 2.5 miles from Hans Flat Ranger Station.

Once back in camp, the guides will assist you with tent set-up.  At this
point your work is done! The guides will set up lawn chairs and hors
d'oeuvres while you enjoy a cold drink as a healthy delicious meal is
prepared.  Washbasins are available for personal use and a solar shower is
usually available for 1 or 2 nights during the trip. This is your time to
relax, whether you chose to lounge around camp with our library of books or
set out for an exploratory hike.

### Day 2
After breakfast we will make our way towards the Maze Overlook.
Expect a beautiful 28 mile day, with the support vehicle loaded with gear
behind.  The route travels along the top of the Orange Cliffs and down the
Flint Trail to the Maze Overlook, one of the most stunning views in
Canyonlands National Park.  The guides will put out a lunch spread along
the way, and be sure to load up on snacks too. Today’s ride takes us and
our campsite for the next 2 nights.

### Day 3
The one mile long Maze Overlook Trail descends 600 feet.  Carefully
make your way down the moki steps and follow a sandy wash to the Harvest
Scene.  Lunch and snacks for the day will be prepared before leaving camp
and carried with you.  Having taken in the rock art, we will return to camp
for a relaxing evening and a filling dinner.  Please note there are exposed
sections on the hike where 3 points of contact may be necessary. There may
be a riding option for anyone who doesn't wish to hike. Camp tonight will
be the same as Day 1, Maze Overlook. The total hiking miles 6

### Day 4
After a hot and hearty breakfast we will breakdown camp and load
the support vehicle.  Expect a full day with wonderful views of Hatch
Canyon on the way to the Teapot Rock Campsite.  Look for petrified wood and
maybe even find an arrowhead near Teapot Rock, but remember to please leave
what you find!  The guides will help to expedite camp set-up, leaving ample
personal time before dinner.  As the guides prepare a dinner, engage with
your new friends in a game of “who can name the most constellations” to
prepare yourself to the Park after dark.  After dinner there is the chance
to take a short hike in the moonlight or gaze to the sky.  Easily view
planets, satellites, the Milky Way, and more in this Gold-Tier
International Dark Sky Park!

### Day 5
Fill up on a delicious breakfast and get ready to head deeper in to
the red rock wilderness!  Today is the most challenging ride.  Be prepared
for undulating technical terrain, though only over a short distance.  This
ride is out-and-back on a rolling jeep road to the Land of Standing Rocks.
If conditions permit we may try to go to the Dolls House the trail can be
pretty sandy. You may ride as far out-and-back as you would like, hike, or
rest for the day.

### Day 6
Get ready for a full final day of riding as the group makes its way
out of the Maze to Hite, Utah, located on the north end of Lake Powell.
After breakfast we will break down camp.  The route consists of rolling
hills over a winding jeep road with beautiful vistas around every bend.
Lunch will be at the end of the trail and is our pick up point. Once at
Hite, we will meet a shuttle driver and take a 2-2.5 hour van ride to the
start of the tour in Green River, UT.  Expect to arrive between 5:00 and
6:00 PM.

      Like nothing else... where outlaws escaped into wildly remote and
                            inaccessible canyons.
