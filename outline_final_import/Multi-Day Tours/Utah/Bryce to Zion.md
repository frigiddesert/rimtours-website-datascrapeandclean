## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
The Red Lion Hotel St. George has a restaurant on site that
offers a very affordable light or full breakfast.  Look for a white Rim
Tours van with utility trailer in the parking lot.  At this point, the
group will load the vehicle, and then drive to Navajo Lake, our basecamp
for the next three nights.  The drive from St. George camp is about 2
hours. At camp, we will unload and get ready to ride! There will be an
orientation, then venture out on the Navajo Lake Loop, a beautiful nine
miles of rolling moderate singletrack with options for additional distance
and challenge.


Once back in camp, the guides will assist you with tent set-up.  At this
point your work is done! The guides will set up lawn chairs and hors
d'oeuvres while you enjoy a cold drink and a healthy delicious meal
Washbasins are available for personal use and a solar shower is usually
available for 1 or 2 nights during the trip. This is your time to relax,
whether you chose to lounge around camp with our library of books or set
out for an exploratory hike.

### Day 2
Fill up on our delicious hot breakfast and get ready to explore!  On
the second day, the group will begin riding the Virgin River Rim Trail and
its singletrack with sweeping turns and challenging (at times) climbs. The
day’s ride will begin from camp and head towards Cascade Falls for lunch
that you will prepare before leaving camp.  The afternoon includes an
optional short hike to view the falls.  From there, riders may choose to
catch a shuttle back to camp or ride back to camp along the southern limits
of this fantastic trail system.  Once we return to camp, kick off your
cycling shoes and relax as the guides prepare a scrumptious dinner.
Mileage: 10-28 miles

### Day 3
Breeze through aspen forests and green meadows on your bike along
the edge of the Markagunt Plateau section of the Virgin River Rim Trail.
Feast your eyes on spectacular views of the wildly eroded Pink Cliffs.  Be
on the lookout for deer and wild turkey!  This ride may be done as an out
and back or you may opt to continue descending and shuttle back to camp
after the 1-way ride to Deer Haven.  Be sure to check out the Bristlecone
pine trees along the route, some of the oldest living trees in the world!
Mileage: 15-25 miles

### Day 4
The final day of riding will be on the classic Thunder Mountain
Trail.  This scenic ridge ride features superb desert style singletrack
with a rolling doubletrack approach on the Great Western Trail.  The trail
climbs and descends through evergreen forests surrounded by out-of-this-
world red rock hoodoos and finishes with another fantastic descent back
into Red Canyon.

After the ride, the group will hop in to a van driven by Rim Tours Staff
and head back to St. George.  Expect to arrive between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.
Please make lodging arrangements in advance, as you may not arrive in time
to catch flights.
Mileage: 8-15 miles
