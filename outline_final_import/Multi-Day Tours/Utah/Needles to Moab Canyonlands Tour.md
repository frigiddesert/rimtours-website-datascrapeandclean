## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Our tour meets at Rim Tours' headquarters at 1233 South Highway
  191 at 8:00 A.M.  Look for our sign on the left as you head south out of
  Moab, about 1.1 miles south of McDonald’s.  You may safely leave your car
  at our headquarters, or you may arrange for a pickup at your hotel.
  Please contact our office to make these arrangements in advance.


  At our office we will provide a continental breakfast while our guides
  load your gear onto the support vehicle.  If you prefer to eat a large
  breakfast, we suggest the Love Muffin Cafe or the Moab Diner, both
  located on Main Street.  After the gear is loaded onto the truck, we will
  shuttle 75 miles to the beginning of our ride.  Along the way we’ll stop
  at Newspaper Rock for a look at ancient rock art.


  Today we will ride out to the Colorado Overlook in the Needles district
  of Canyonlands Nations Park. We will make a quick stop at the visitor’s
  center then head out for our ride from there. Mileage is approximately 14
  miles out and back.
  We’ll leave the park and ride 7 miles of pavement to our camp at Indian
  Creek campground set amongst fabulous red rock formations.


  Once camp is set, your work is done!  Your guides will take care of all
  the details from preparing hors d'oeuvres to cooking up a healthy
  delicious meal.  Washbasins are available for clean-up and a solar shower
  is usually available for one evening during the trip.  It's your time to
  relax, whether it's lounging around camp with our library of books or
  setting out for a hike to explore your surroundings.

### Day 2
Our ride today starts on the Lockhart Basin Trail.  We’ll cross
  Indian Creek and you may catch a glimpse of ancient Indian ruins
  alongside the trail.  The route roughly parallels the Colorado River, and
  the views into Canyonlands National Park are stunning.  The riding is
  fast and fun, and we’ll set up camp along the trail at one of the many
  scenic overlooks along the route.  Mileage is approximately 20.

### Day 3
Today’s 23-mile ride is the most challenging of the trip, and
  includes several short, steep climbs and narrow rocky descents.  The
  support truck will bypass this section and met us at camp from the
  opposite direction.  We will camp at a beautiful location near Chicken
  Corners above the Colorado River.







  Because today’s ride is unsupported, you will need to carry water, lunch
  and a few items of clothing.
  A hydration pack with at least a 70-oz. bladder and enough room to carry
  some gear is recommended. If you prefer a daypack, please bring one with
  the capacity for at least 2 large water bottles and some gear.

### Day 4
Today we’ll climb up to Hurrah Pass; it will be a challenging ride
  but well worth it for the views at the top! We’ll descend down the other
  side into Kane Creek Canyon, where we’ll ride alongside towering canyon
  walls on our way back to Moab.  Total mileage is approximately 20.






                                    Note:
    Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including but not
 limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip logistics
                              and rider safety.



                     We look forward to riding with you!
