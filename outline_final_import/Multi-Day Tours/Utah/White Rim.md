**Long Description:**
> The White Rim Trail, located in the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park, is truly a special place. This classic tour is a must for anyone visiting Utah's canyon country, offering a perfect combination of great riding and spectacular scenery.  We ride along the "White Rim" layer of sandstone, with dramatic canyons below and majestic red rock cliffs above. The trail leads to arches, towers and other fantastic rock formations. Your guides will lead you on bike and on foot to explore the hidden treasures the White Rim offers. Visit an Indian dwelling of ancient times or perhaps trek into a slot canyon disappearing into the desert sandstone. The White Rim is the trip of a lifetime. On the four-day tour, we ride approximately 20 - 25 miles each day. On the three-day tour, we ride approximately 30 - 35 miles each day.
