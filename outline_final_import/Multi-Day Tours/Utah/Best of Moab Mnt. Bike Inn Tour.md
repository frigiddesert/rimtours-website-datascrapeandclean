### Day 1
Our guides will pick you up at your hotel time is dependent on
season, but either 8am or 9am.
Today we’ll ride in the Island in the Sky District of Canyonlands National
Park.  Panoramic views and rolling terrain make this is an excellent first
day ride; the riding is challenging, but not too technical.  We only do
this if we have a group of 4 or more. Options for smaller groups include
Dead Horse Point and the Moab Brand Trails.
The group will meet for dinner tonight at Pasta Jay’s, or 98 Center.

### Day 2
Today’s ride will be at the Klondike Singletrack Area.  This ride
showcases some of the best Moab terrain, lots of single-track for different
levels, fun Slickrock riding, and stunning views into Arches National Park
combine to make this a ride you’ll never forget.
Dinner tonight is at Miguel’s Baja Grill or Fiesta Mexicana.

### Day 3
Guides will pick you up at your hotel.  Today’s ride will be
determined by your guides and the group on day 2; options include the
Magnificent 7, Navajo Rocks, and Slickrock Trail or Porcupine for more
advanced groups.  All of these rides are challenging, scenic and a great
way to end the tour.  Lunch today may be trailside or back in town after
the ride.

hold your luggage at our office, and you are welcome to shower at our
