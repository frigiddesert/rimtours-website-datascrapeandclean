## 1. The Shared DNA
**Subtitle:** WE ARE OFFERING AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN BIKEPACKING THAT WILL TEACH PARTICIPANTS ALL YOU NEED TO SET OUT ON YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT TOURS.  
**Region:** Moab Area  
**Skill Level:**   
**Season:** Spring|Summer

**Short Description:**
> Join us for a 4-day backcountry adventure, this is an introductory course in bikepacking that would teach participants all you need to set out on their own independent tours.

**Long Description:**
> Bikepacking is exciting and rewarding form of off-pavement, adventure bike touring. You carry all your gear on the bike, from food/water to camp kit to repairs and navigation. Think ultralight backpacking, but on your mountain bike!
We are offering introductory courses in bikepacking that would teach participants all you need to set out on their own independent tours. Given the educational nature of this experience, the layout will look a little different than our classic supported tour offerings. Both courses will cover all the same information and skills, but the riding/shakedown tour portion of each course will be in different levels of terrain challenge.
Our May trip will feature intermediate terrain with more challenging climbs and some technical sections of 4x4 roads while the June date will ride on moderate terrain with less technical challenge. Day 1 for both trips facilitates a clinic on preparation and packing for your ride and Days 2-4 will be out on the trail putting it all into practice.
