## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
This trip will meet at 7:30 a.m. at Rim Tours’ Headquarters
  in Moab, Utah. After loading the van, we will drive to Boulder, Utah
  on the edge of Grand Staircase-Escalante, the drive is approximately
  3 1/2 hours.


  **You may meet us in Green River, Utah if this is more suitable to
  your travel plans. Please call us in advance to arrange and for
  specific times. **


  The drive is beautiful and the scenery will range from stark wide open
  desert to the tight canyons of Capitol Reef and aspen covered Boulder
  Mountain as we work our way to the remote town of Boulder and our ride
  begins just outside of town.   We’ll head a short ways down the beginning
  of the Burr Trail to our jumping off point for biking as we head into the
  backcountry. We begin with a downhill ride on the Burr Trail through the
  newly established Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. After
  years of controversy, the first 30 miles of this trail have been paved.
  The trail gradually descends through first farmland into interesting
  slickrock formations. As we drop into the narrows of Long Canyon, sheer
  sandstone walls rise for several hundred feet above us. Along the way
  we’ll pass through The Gulch, The Circle Cliffs and Deer Creek Recreation
  Area. A moderate climb brings us to Studhorse Peaks, our “camp with a
  view” for the next two nights. Our 270 degree view includes the Henry
  Mountains to the east, Boulder Mountain to the north and Navajo Mountain
  to the south, one of the four sacred mountains for the Navajo people.
  Mileage: 28 miles; optional hiking from camp and support vehicle are
  available throughout the day.

### Day 2
Your guides will serve up a hot and yummy breakfast and today we
  will ride a loop from camp on the Wolverine Loop Road. The road provides
  some great swooping downhill sections interspersed with a few rolling
  climbs. We begin in the Pinyon and Juniper trees and drop down below the
  Windgate Sandstone. Views of the Henry mountains, which rise 7,000 feet
  from the surrounding countryside, are spectacular. Along the way we visit
  Wolverine Petrified Wood Area where we can learn even more about the vast
  natural history of our surroundings. Continuing on we will pedal through
  Horse and Wolverine Canyons, where the road and drainage become one,
  eventually re-joining the Burr Trail and back to our same camp. Mileage:
  28 miles with support available for the last 1/3 of the day.

### Day 3
After breakfast we head east through the twisted rock formations
  of the Waterpocket Fold, an abrupt geologic formation. As we enter
  Capitol Reef National Park, the contrast of the mountains and canyons
  creates a dramatic interface. After a quick five miles, we’ll turn off
  the Burr Trail and ride out to the trailhead at Upper Muley Twist Canyon.
   At the beginning of our hike, we’ll have a wonderful view looking right
  up the fold. This canyon was named by the Mormons who arrived in their
  wagons. They said traveling through the canyon would “twist a mule.” The
  Henry Mountains will remain a presence in our sights, a wild high country
  in the midst of these red rock canyons. Free roaming buffalo herds are
  still part of the mountain ecosystem. After our hike we are back on the
  Burr Trail topping out the Waterpocket Fold switchbacks. Descending the
  spectacular switchbacks places us at the base of the fold where we head
  south to our camp at the Brimhall Arch Overlook. As always there is
  exploring on foot from camp. Mileage: 29 miles riding; 1 mile hike plus
  options from camp.

### Day 4
Our final day of the tour features the most primitive section of
  the entire tour. Along this double track road, we will experience a few
  short, technical sections as we cross a series of drainages. Our route
  will parallel Muley Twist Canyon to the west and Bullfrog Creek to the
  east. Once we hit the pavement, our ride is all downhill to Bullfrog Bay,
  on the shores of Lake Powell. The lake itself is quite stunning despite
  all the beauty of Glen Canyon covered by its blue waters. From our finish
  here with lunch at the lake, we will shuttle the group back to Moab or
  alternate meeting locations, expect to be back between 4:00 – 5:00pm.
  Mileage: 16 miles


  Note:  Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including but
