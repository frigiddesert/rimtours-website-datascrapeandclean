## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Meet at Sky Harbor Sleep Inn near the Phoenix International
Airport; please have breakfast before meeting your guides at 9:00 am.  We
begin with a shuttle to McDowell Sonoran Preserve for our first day’s ride.
 The preserve offers over 100 miles of multi-use trails to explore and is a
great warm-up to the more challenging trails to come.  This part of the
Sonoran Desert is one of the most diverse environments on earth.  With over
100 species of reptiles, 60 mammals, 350 birds and 2000 plants making a
home in the desert, you never know what we will run into out here!  Today’s
ride will be between 17 – 30 miles.  Camp for first 2 nights will be at
nearby McDowell Mtn. Park.

### Day 2
Today we will ride some of the fantastic trails at McDowell Mtn.
Park, either the main perimeter or interior trails in the heart of the park
or head over to the competitive track which offers options.  The Long Loop
– designed for the average rider, but fun for all abilities.  The Sport
Loop which is super fun and designed for the intermediate and advanced
riders has short steep climbs, banked turns and fast descents.  The
Technical Loop is designed for the expert rider.  This trail has very steep
climbs, technical descents and rugged terrain.  Whichever trail we choose
today, the riding will be super fun, mellow to as hard as you want.
Mileage today will be 14 – 22 miles.

### Day 3
Today after a delicious breakfast prepared by your guides’ we will
break camp and head to the start of the Black Canyon Trail.  We head north
toward the Bradshaw Mountains which run north/south.  Our starting point is
the highest point of the entire route with topography of high desert
dropping us down into the Sonoran Desert and Saguaro country.  Our ride
ends at Bumble Bee Ranch where we will camp for the next 2 nights with the
luxuries of showers and a comfy campground.  Today’s mileage with a net
downhill is about 25 miles but by no means an easy cruise.  We will work
hard for our descending miles and arrive tired and happy.

### Day 4
Today we ride from Bumble Bee and into the canyons of the Agua Fria
River and the foothills of the Bradshaw Mountains.  Our ride takes us
across breathtaking Mesas and along flowing bench cut singletrack through
thousands of Saguaro cactus and above deep canyons of the Agua Fria River.
Our ride will be as flowy and fun as yesterday with a few more technical
challenges and a river crossing.  We end our ride in Black Canyon City and
shuttle back to our camp at Bumble Bee.  Our mileage today is 22 miles.

### Day 5
Today we break camp and shuttle back to Black Canyon City for our
final day on the BCT and is really the heart and soul of the entire route.
We will have majestic views and a primo trail through a variety of Sonoran
plant life and another river crossing.  The trail gets smoother and faster
as we near our finish.  Today’s ride is 22 miles and we will transport you
at the end back to Phoenix to your hotel or even to the airport if you
arrange a late flight out.
