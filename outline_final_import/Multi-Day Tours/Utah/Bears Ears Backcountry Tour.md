## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
On our way to the trailhead we pass through Blanding where we will
  stop at the Edge of the Cedars Museum to learn more about the ancient
  peoples of the 4 corners region.  After this educational and truly
  interesting stop we’ll drive on towards the start of our bike ride on the
  south side of the 8,000-foot Bear’s Ears Pass, close to Natural Bridges
  National Monument.   We’ll ride up and over the pass and check out the
  views into upper Arch Canyon on our way to camp overlooking another
  spectacular canyon, Hammond Canyon.  We’ll stay here for 2 nights and
  with good eyes or binoculars there are ancient ruins of cliff dwellings
  across the canyon.  Your guides will set up a cozy camp in the ponderosas
  and take care of all the details while there are opportunities from camp
  for hiking or riding extra miles.  Washbasins are available for cleanup
  and a solar shower is usually available for 1-2 evenings during the trip.
   Scrumptious hors d’oeuvres and a delicious, healthy meal will cap off a
  perfect, action-filled day!  Stories around the campfire will cap off
  your first day into the southwest wilderness.

### Day 2
Upon waking you’ll smell the scent of coffee brewing and the
  noises of breakfast.  After eating we’ll head on down the trail.  Our
  ride today includes a rip-roaring descent to the trailhead of our hike.
  On foot we’ll explore the high plateau desert surroundings and view
  spectacular and well-hidden cliff dwellings which demonstrate the
  ingenuity and building skills of our long ago inhabitants of this region.
   We recommend bringing small binoculars for this hike if you have them.
  After the hike, you may choose the challenge of riding back up to camp or
  opt to save your energy for the days ahead and catch a ride with the
  support vehicle.  Miles range from 12-18 for this out and back excursion
  plus 5-6 miles of hiking.

### Day 3
After another delicious breakfast, we’ll begin our traverse the
  Elk Ridge Plateau.  Aspen meadows line our route as we make our way to
  Big Notch – a challenging climb but well worth it for the views at the
  top!  After lunch, the riding is fast and fun as we descend towards
  Cathedral Butte and our final resting place at Cathedral point.  Our camp
  tonight overlooks Canyonlands National Park and is truly one of the most
  sensational campsites in the area.  Mileage is approximately 25 miles.

### Day 4
Our ride today is fast, fun and mostly downhill!  We’ll lose over
  1,000 feet of elevation as we descend toward Dugout Ranch and the world
  famous Indian Creek climbing area.  We’ll have lunch and check out the
  petroglyphs & pictographs at Newspaper Rock and then head back to Moab.
  Miles today are 17 or 25 if we ride the pavement to Newspaper Rock.
  After lunch we’ll shuttle back to Moab to arrive between 3:00-4:00 pm.



                     We look forward to riding with you!
