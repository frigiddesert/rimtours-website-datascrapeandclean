## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Meet: 9am Durango City Transit
  Ride:
  Trails:
  Camp: Junction Creek campground
  Meals: lunch and dinner
  Snacks included on all days!

### Day 2
After a hearty breakfast, we’ll head to our ride on the famous
   Hermosa Creek Trail above Purgatory Ski Resort.  This 20-mile trail is a
   classic in Durango and includes rolling terrain with lots of descending
   on buffed singletrack.   This is a great ride to test and improve your
   singletrack skills, as we’ll encounter a variety of trail conditions and
   terrain.  Your guides are great instructors and are happy to offer
   helpful tips and pointers on riding techniques – just ask!  We finish the
   ride near Hermosa where a vehicle will be waiting for a quick shuttle
   back to base camp.

### Day 3
Today we’ll ride a section of the Colorado Trail high above
  Durango.  This ride is sure to test your downhill riding technique as the
  trail loses 5,000 ft. over 26 miles!  There is one 1,000-ft. climb in the
  middle of the ride but that just means more descending!  This is one of
  our favorite sections of trail in all of Colorado.

### Day 4
For our final day’s ride, we’ll ride right from camp and explore
  the multiple loops of the Log Chutes trail system or venture to the Horse
  Gulch trails east of town.  Meandering singletrack, fantastic riding, and
  a fast cruise from either ride into Durango make a fitting finale for our
  tour.  Expect to finish up between 2:00 – 3:00 pm today.


  Note:  The nature of a single-track tour prevents the support truck from
  accompanying the riders.  Each rider is responsible for carrying his/her
  own lunch, water, and gear for the day's ride.


  Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including but not
  limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip
  logistics and rider safety.






























            Please call or e-mail with any questions or concerns!




                     We look forward to riding with you!
