## 1. The Shared DNA
**Subtitle:** Featuring longtime favorites Teocalli Ridge, Reno Ridge and more excellent ebike rides  
**Region:** Colorado  
**Skill Level:**   
**Season:** Summer

**Short Description:**
> "The Butte" is one of the best places you will ever ride, period. This is the place to experience pristine singletrack that has been featured in bike magazines since the inception of the Pearl Pass ride in 1976.

**Long Description:**
> "The Butte" is one of the best places you will ever ride, period. This is the place to experience pristine singletrack that has been featured in bike magazines since the inception of the Pearl Pass ride in 1976. Our trail choices are longtime favorites including Teocalli Ridge, Reno Ridge, Brush Creek and more.
You'll view mountain peaks in every direction as well as the best wildflower show in Colorado. Camp each day is beside a roaring creek, and within moments of the trail. Elevations range from 9,000 to 12,000 feet with mileage ranging from 17-30 miles a day. Plan an extra day or two to take in one of the many summer festivals and to explore the picturesque town of Crested Butte.
We have been loving Ebikes in the Crested Butte high country, and can't wait to share more of it with you all.  We are pioneering backcountry ebike adventures and our solar-battery charging systems will keep the batteries charged up.
eBikes are allowed on motorized trails in the Crested Butte area on Gunnison National Forest Lands. Fortunately, many classic rides are part of this fantastic network, but not 401, or Doctors Park.  Expect to get off the beaten path, ride new trails, and maybe an extra lap of your favorite too.  These singletrack trails are Upper Intermediate riding, but can be tailored to the group's interests.

## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Our Crested Butte Singletrack Tours meets in Crested Butte at 9:00
  AM on the morning of departure at the Chamber of Commerce Parking lot at
  the corner of Hwy. 135 and Elk Avenue (the 4-way stop sign).  Please make
  sure to have a good breakfast before we meet.  We will arrange to leave
  your cars here or nearby for the length of the trip.  If you need
  transportation the day before from Gunnison, please make these
  arrangements in advance there are several companies that offer shuttle
  service.  At our meeting place we will pack your gear into "dry bags" and
  load the support vehicle, which will meet us each day at camp.


  Our ride begins with a short ride out of town on pavement, which then
  turns to dirt.  We’ll ride the Upper Loop towards Brush Creek beneath Mt.
  Crested Butte. The ride today is not overly long to give you a chance to
  acclimate.  We’ll camp at Brush Creek amongst the aspens. There are
  beautiful hiking opportunities from camp.  Mileage: 16 miles with option
  for additional miles.


  Once camp is set your work is done!  Your guides will take care of the
  details from setting up chairs with hors d'oeuvres and the drink cooler
  nearby, to cooking up a healthy delicious meal.  We have washbasins
  available to clean up with and a solar shower will be available for at
  least 1 night during the trip.  It's your time to relax, whether it's
  lounging around camp with our library of books or setting out for a hike
  to explore your surroundings.

### Day 2
We ride right from our camp at Brush Creek and head towards
  Teocalli Ridge, we will start our climb on a 4x4 road for about 2 miles
  and then we will hit the singletrack and we will spend a good amount of
  time climbing, winding through aspens with beautiful views. Once we reach
  the top of the ridge it will be worth the 2000 ft. descent, which has
  rocky, ledgy and steep sections.

### Day 3
After a hearty and hot breakfast, we will climb from camp on a
  double track for a few miles before it turns to singletrack and we have
  now reached the start of the Deer Creek Trail.  We’ll climb and descend
  through beautiful groves of aspens, opening to spectacular views of Mt.
  Crested Butte and the East River.  Eventually we descend into the East
  River at the base of Mt. Crested Butte. We will shuttle about an hour to
  our camp at Cement Creek. Riders will have the option of additional
  riding from camp, hiking or relaxing.   Mileage:  15-20 miles.

### Day 4
Today we head up to Reno Divide and the trailhead for Flag Creek,
  Bear Creek and Deadman's Gulch Trails. These series of buff singletrack
  are unique to the Crested Butte area, and this is about as good as it
  gets for awesome singletrack!  You're sure to end the day smiling after
  this 22-mile classic “CB” ride.

### Day 5
Our final day we’ll ride up Doctor Park on our way back towards
  the town of Crested Butte. Our final ride weaves in and out of aspen
  groves and through beautiful meadows of wildflowers.  Apart from the
  initial climb, the ride is mostly rolling with the final option of either
  riding the Upper Loop back to town or taking an easy cruise back to town
  on the road. Miles today total 20.


  Our main goal for our mountain tours is an early start each morning.
  This will allow us to be up and over the high passes of the trail before
  the possible afternoon thundershowers.  We will ask you to be prepared
  for as early a departure as the guides deem necessary, which will
  probably be 8:30-9:00 A.M. on most mornings.


                                                                   IMPORTANT
        Itineraries are subject to change based on factors including but not
 limited to weather, road and trail conditions, camp permits, trip logistics
                                                           and rider safety.

                     We look forward to riding with you!
