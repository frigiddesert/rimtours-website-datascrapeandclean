## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Our tour starts west of Blanding near the 8,000-foot Bear’s Ears
  Pass which has been appropriated as the name of our newest National
  Monument.   On the way to our drop off point we will take a short detour
  to view ancient Puebloan ruins that are over 700 years old.  We’ll
  shuttle up and over the pass to start our ride of 15+ miles to our first
  camp amidst the aspens and pines of this cool oasis rising out of the
  desert below.  There will be options for additional miles today along the
  main route.


  Once at camp, relax under the ponderosa pines and take in the view of
  nearby canyons while our guides take care of all the details.  Washbasins
  are available for cleanup and a solar shower is usually available for an
  evening during the trip.  Scrumptious hors d’oeuvres and a delicious,
  healthy meal will cap off a perfect, action-filled day!

### Day 2
Today we’ll traverse the Elk Ridge Plateau.  Aspen meadows line
  our route as we make our way to Big Notch – a challenging climb but well
  worth it for the views at the top!  After lunch, the riding is rolling
  and fun as we travel towards the north end of Elk Ridge and our camp high
  above the Canyonlands below.  This camp has wonderful views for the
  sunset and the spectacular canyons surrounding us.  Mileage is
  approximately 20 miles.

### Day 3
Our ride today is fast, fun and mostly downhill!  We’ll lose over
  2,000 feet of elevation as we descend toward Dugout Ranch, a historic and
  still working cattle ranch.  We’ll enjoy our final lunch under the
  cottonwood trees along Indian Creek and check out the nearby petroglyphs
  & pictographs at Newspaper Rock before heading back to Moab.  Total
  Mileage: 25+




                     We look forward to riding with you!
