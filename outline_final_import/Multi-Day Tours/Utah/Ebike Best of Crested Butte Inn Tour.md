## 4. Full Itinerary Text
### Day 1
Our guides will meet you at the Inn at 8 AM and we’ll take care of
bike fittings and any last-minute details.  Today we’ll ride up the Brush
Creek area on Strand Hill and Faris Creek.  There are plenty of options to
make this ride longer or shorter as some folks may feel the high
elevations.  Panoramic views of Mt. Crested Butte and the surrounding Elk
mountains will astound you and rolling terrain make this is an excellent
first day ride; the riding is challenging, but not too technical.
Everything is within walking distance of your lodge.

### Day 2
Today’s ride will be either Deer Creek or Teocalli Ridge.  This ride
ends near Gothic Mountain, which is a prominent peak you’ll see from town,
and we’ll pass through the town of Gothic on our way back to town.  Rocky
Mountain Biological Institute sets up a summer research station here and
it’s always interesting to see what they are studying.  This is classic
Crested Butte ride with some challenging climbing sections and super fun
singletrack trail riding.  The Rocky Mountains are spectacular in the
summer, particularly for the wildflowers, and you’ll find yourself wanting
to linger in the backcountry as long as you can each day.

### Day 3
Guides will pick you up at your lodge.  Today’s ride will be
determined by your guides and the group on day 2; options may include the
409 Trail, or possibly the 401 Trail from Schofield Pass, or Doctor Park.
All of these rides are challenging, scenic and a great way to end the tour.
 Lunch today may be trailside or back in town after the ride. You will need
to check out of your lodge today unless you make arrangements to stay on
longer; we will arrange to hold your luggage at the lodge or store it in
our van for the day.  Our tour concludes early to mid afternoon – thanks
for riding with us!
